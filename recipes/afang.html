    <p>Afang soup is made from Afang leaves (otherwise known as wild spinach, kkazi, Koko, fumbua or eru) and Waterleaf o. There are different versions across Africa and even in the diaspora. The waterleaf can be substituted for spinach since waterleaf is not readily available everywhere. This leafy, savoury soup is cooked with palm oil and served alongside Nigerian swallow such as eba, pounded yam and semovita</p>
    <p>This recipe is the diaspora version and probably the cheapest version.</p>
